# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my submission of this coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building real projects.



## The challenge

Your challenge was to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


I noticed the data for the results in a local `data.json` file. So I  used that to add the results and total score dynamically but instead of fetching the data I changed the JSON data to an array and mapped through it and dynamically displayed the data in the summary card 

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

This project's required assets are in the `/assets` folder. It also includes variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project.

## Building the project

Below is the process, and the steps I followed:

1. I Initialized a project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how  to tackle the project. In this project, I did the mobile design first and worked my way up to the desktop screen size 
4. I also  structured the content with HTML. As writing  HTML first  helped me focus my attention on creating well-structured content. Also, it helped me know how to  structure the data coming from JavaScript for easier styling. 

## Deploying the project
I used Netlify to deploy this project.
